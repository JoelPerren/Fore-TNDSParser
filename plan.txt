OUTPUT:
{LINE} ({DIRECTION}).csv

PSUDO-CODE:
for each direction
    for each vehicle journey
        for each leg
            write ({TIME}, {STOP ID}) tuple
        write new line

Therefore we need:
- Line name
- Possible directions in the route
- List of vehicle journey objects
    > direction information
    > initial time
    > List of (ordered) leg objects
        >> start stop ID
        >> end stop ID
        >> duration
